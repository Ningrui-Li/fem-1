Scat amp

 All I did for this was change the call that sets phantom.amplitude to randn()
 and pulled it outside of the for loop so that it only happens once in the
 script. Iâ€™ve been running sims with a large scatterer mesh (~2 million
 scatterers) and as far as I can tell it seems to work (the RF lines look fine
 and motion tracking with NCC works as expected). The mean of the RF lines is
 somewhere around -1.7e-26, which I assume is so small that it can be counted
 as zero-mean (although Doug will probably have to double check this). Not sure
 what could be going on with your calc_scat, we are using the older version of
 Field so maybe some bug was introduced further down the line?  Here is the
 call:

% Insert amplitudes for scatterers

phantom.amplitude = randn(PPARAMS.N,1);
